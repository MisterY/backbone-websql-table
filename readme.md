<h1>Backbone WebSQL Table adapter</h1>

<p>Intended for use with PhoneGap, Backbone, and WebSQL.</p>

<p>This adapter plugs into Backbone so that collections and models synchronize with WebSQL storage. WebSQL is offered by PhoneGap as the default storage method, provided by Android WebView.</p>

<p>The approach taken with this plugin is to store each model's value into a separate column so that all the benefits of relational storage, like filtering per attribute and fetching related entities, are available to a developer.</p>

<p>See tests for more information on how to use.</p>
